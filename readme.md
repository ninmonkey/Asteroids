# about

Asteroids clone without libraries, uses ES6 features. I  purposely don't use `class` keyword.

# future

- ship and rocks with coordinates
- then ship class using Vector
- refactor globals
- profile speed, only update dirty rects
- use more canvases for performance such as ship/rock/bg.
- Vector2d
- auto-pause when changing focus on tab or windows?

# todo: specifics
- vector
    - dot product
    - normalize()
    - scale len to X

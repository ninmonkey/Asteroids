# about

Asteroids clone without libraries, uses ES6 features. I  purposely don't use `class` keyword.

# future

- Ship/Asteroid mixin entitiy class
- then ship class using Vector
- refactor globals
- profile speed, only update dirty rects
- use more canvases for performance such as ship/rock/bg.
- Vector2d
- auto-pause when changing focus on tab or windows?
- replace ship.log() with json.dump(ship) ?

# todo: specifics
- ES6 imports, or
    - module pattern if browsers don't support modules 
- vector
    - dot product
    - normalize()
    - scale len to X
